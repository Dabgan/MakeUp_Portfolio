## Technologies

In this project I used:

-   Gatsby - to generate fast and good performing website
-   Typescript -  because I wanted to learn how to use it on a real project
-   SCSS + CSS Modules - never used CSS modules before, so I wanted to try it
-   DatoCMS - headless CMS for content management
-   GraphQL - to get only necessary data
